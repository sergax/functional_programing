# The general course information

As you probably know, recently functional programming has ceased to be considered as some kind of a toy for computer scientists. Many widely used programming languages have acquired different concepts from this paradigm to solve problems related to software design, code readability, and concurrency. Java isn't an exception and has started supporting plenty of concepts from the functional paradigm since the 8th version. As the result, It has drastically affected the way how programmers write programs using Java. There is no doubt that this trend will continue evolving in future versions of the language. In this regard, the authors of this course believe it's very important to learn the basics of the functional programming and start using them to solve real programming challenges.

So, welcome to the Java. Functional Programming course!


# What you will learn

The course introduces elements of functional programming in Java 8-11, including lambda expressions and method references, functional interfaces and monads, the Stream API and lazy evaluation, as well as some other concepts. It gives you a practical approach to programming without unnecessary abstractions.

The syllabus consists of several modules revealing diverse aspects of functional programming in Java. Each module contains one or more lessons consisting of theory and exercises. It is worth noting that the first half of the course tends to be more theoretical, whereas the second part contains much more coding exercises.

Since this course wasn't meant to be an easy walk, sometimes you may struggle with difficult exercises, which are usually marked with the [HARD] tag. If you cannot solve an exercise, you can just skip it and then return back once you are ready. Another possible option is to read comments and ask your questions there. Please, do not forget to consider various corner cases for input data: what if the input values of an exercise are zero, negative, empty collections and so on. Keeping this in mind will help you to pass most of the hard problems here.
