 * Replacing digits of a number
 * In this task, you need to write your own rule and pass it to the substitution method to replace the digits of a number. The definition is exactly the same as shown in the previous step.
 *
 * public static int substitution(long n, Function<Integer, Integer> digitRule)
 * The rule should act as the following:
 *
 * if the digit is 5, it should replace it with 1;
 * if the digit is 6, it should replace it with 2;
 * if the digit is 7, it should replace it with 3;
 * if the digit is 8, it should replace it with 4;
 * if the digit is 9, it should replace it with 5;
 * any other digits shouldn't be replaced.
 * There is a whole variety of ways to contrive this rule. The shorter your solution, the better! :)
 *
 * Note that the substitution method belongs to the Utils class.
 *
 * Sample Input:
 *
 * 12765
 * Sample Output:
 *
 * 12321
